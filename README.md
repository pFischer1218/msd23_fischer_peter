# Strings.java
Strings.java is a Java Project, which allows the user to encrypt a String by using a Ceaser Cipher
## Installation
Download the Java Project and locate its directory.
Enter the directory over the commandline and run it by entering: java Strings.java 

```bash
C:\Users\user\Downloads\Project\src>java Strings.java
```

## Usage
```bash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - Encrypt text
2 - Decrypt text
9 - Quit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Inputting the 1 or 2 without spaces will allow the user to input the amount by which the text will be shifted. The user is able to shift all charcters from [A-Z], [a-z] and [0-9]. Should the amount added to the characters shift them out of these ranges, then it will continue from the beginning of the character bounds. Entering 1 will shift the characters to the right, entering 2 will shift it left and entering 9 will end the program.

```bash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - Encrypt text
2 - Decrypt text
9 - Quit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1
  Enter rotation: 9
  Enter text to encrypt: 1
  Encrypted text: 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
