# Strings.java
Strings.java is a Java Project, which allows the user to encrypt a String by using a Ceaser Cipher
## Installation
Download the Java Project and locate its directory.
Enter the directory over the commandline and run it by entering: java Strings.java 

```bash
C:\Users\user\Downloads\Project\src>java Strings.java
```

## Usage
```bash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - Encrypt text
2 - Decrypt text
9 - Quit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Inputting the 1 or 2 without spaces will allow the user to input the amount by which the text will be shifted. The user is able to shift all charcters from [A-Z], [a-z] and [0-9]. Should the amount added to the characters shift them out of these ranges, then it will continue from the beginning of the character bounds. Entering 1 will shift the characters to the right, entering 2 will shift it left and entering 9 will end the program.

```bash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - Encrypt text
2 - Decrypt text
9 - Quit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1
  Enter rotation: 9
  Enter text to encrypt: 1
  Encrypted text: 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
## Contributions
The Project currently is not open for any contributions.

## Log config template file
The file src/main/resources/log4j2.xml.template can be used to configure the logger. The user can change the path and filename in which the logs are stored. Furthermore, the current pattern can be changed from the current date and time and log message. Minimum log level and if the file gets appended with new logs can also be changed as wished.
